Week 3 
Topic: Refactoring 
Refactoring is the process of writing the code first and then making changes that make it reusable and readable. It is a discipline-specific technique for restructuring an existing body of code without changing its external behaviour. Each transformation, called refactoring, does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances of it becoming seriously broken during the restructuring.

 ## Refactoring may be conducted at any time but is most often triggered due to a code issue. 

•	“Code smell” is a term for code that does not adhere t o expected design principles or heuristics.
•	This is subjective the design principles and heuristics in question may change with language, IDE, developer, Software, etc.

## Addressing refactoring concerns regularly can help avoid technical debt

•	Technical debt occurs when easy solutions (I.e. “band-aid” solutions) rather than thoughtful and comprehensive solutions are applied to a given problem 
•	Code rot – the deterioration of code quality over time, due to software or environment changes-can also contributes to technical debt.
•	Significant technical debt can force a code to rewrite – ideally to be avoided.

## A rewrite typically refers to a reimplementation without source code
•	This is a major undertaking, especially for mission-critical software.
•	Often rewrite comes with additional features implementation.
•	A forced means a significant loss of productivity and the possibility of revenue 

## We can think of two broad approaches to refactoring opportunistic vs intentional 

•	Opportunistic: refactoring occurs during the process of code writing, or perhaps as the result of a code review. These types of refactoring are relatively low-risk and easy to perform, yet provide immediate benefits.
•	Intentional: refactoring is a more thoughtful and considered approach that is part of a regular process, either daily or multiple times per week. This intentional process is a good one to adopt to ensure you remain familiar with your code.

##  Let’s make refactoring a part of your routine. As Often as you can is reasonable 

•	Examine small sections of your codebase from the perspective of a new user. 

## The above are all the class notes that i have taken and understood .
